			<h2>Who Am I?</h2>
			<p>
				👋 Hi! I’m Suyash—an independent consultant living in the Lowlands for almost 10 years now. 🌍 Originally from India 🇮🇳, I’ve found my second home here in the Netherlands 🇳🇱, and I’m loving it!
			</p>
			<p>
				🎬 Big fan of Kung Fu Panda here! 🐼 I couldn’t resist adopting the word "Ska-doosh" 💥—especially when Po flexes his pinkie to defeat Tai Lung. That moment? Legendary. 😎
			</p>
			<p>
				If you’d like to know more about me, how about we chat over a ☕ coffee, either in person or virtually via Teams? 💻
